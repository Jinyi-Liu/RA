Unless a holder of Series A Preferred Stock elects otherwise, its ability to convert its Series A Preferred Stock into 
common stock or to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis is restricted to the extent that such conversion 
would result in the holder owning more than **4.99%** of our issued and outstanding common stock or voting together with 
the common stock on an as-if-converted to common stock basis in respect of more than 4.99% of our issued and outstanding 
common stock. Eight holders of our Series A Preferred Stock have elected not to be governed by these restrictions, 
although we have entered into an agreement with one such holder whereby that holder's ability to convert or vote 
its shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not be subject to a beneficial ownership cap of 4.99%. Consequently, 
giving effect to the beneficial ownership cap restrictions, the Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding 
as of March 28, 2008 is convertible into **11,666,195** shares of common stock and the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock 
vote on an as-converted basis with the holders of our common stock.
